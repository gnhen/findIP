# findIP
Incredibly simple program.

I got tired of running cmd and typing ipconfig to find my public IPv4

So, I created a short script.

# Installation
Download all files

Place all in a folder that you won't delete

Create a batch script
```
@echo off
python "your\file\location\for\ipv4-finder.py"
```
Create a shortcut for the batch script

Rename shortcut to ```Find IPv4```

Place shortcut in Windows Start Menu folder

# Usage

Press Windows key

Type ```Find IPv4``` and run it

The Public Facing IPv4 will appear

Press ```C``` to copy, or ```Q``` to close the command prompt
